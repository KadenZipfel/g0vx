Want to make use of G0VX in your organization? Simply follow these steps. 
[Difficulty: Intermediate]

**Note**: ðŸ’€ This project has yet to be audited. Use at your own risk. ðŸ’€ 

- `git clone` this repository
- In the root directory, create a new file called `keys.js` with your private key as below
```
module.exports = {
  privKey: 'PRIVATE_KEY'
}
```
**Note**: Be sure to gitignore `keys.js`
- Setup truffle-config with your own [infura](https://infura.io/) API's
```
const path = require("path");
const HDWalletProvider = require("truffle-hdwallet-provider");
const keys = require('./keys');

module.exports = {
  // See <http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/configuration>
  // to customize your Truffle configuration!
  contracts_build_directory: path.join(__dirname, "client/src/contracts"),
  networks: {
    develop: {
      port: 8545
    },
    ropsten: {
      provider: () => {
        return new HDWalletProvider(keys.privKey, "ROPSTEN_API_HERE");
      },
      network_id: 3
    },
    rinkeby: {
      provider: () => {
        return new HDWalletProvider(keys.privKey, "RINKEBY_API_HERE");
      },
      network_id: 4
    },
    mainnet: {
      provider: () => {
        return new HDWalletProvider(keys.privKey, "MAINNET_API_HERE");
      },
      network_id: 1
    }
  }
};
```
- In `migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js`, set the contract time limit (The length of time users can vote on a proposal in seconds)
```
var Governance = artifacts.require("./Governance.sol");

module.exports = function(deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(Governance, TIME_LIMIT_HERE_IN_SECONDS);
};
```
- From the root directory, run `npm install`
- From `/client`, again run `npm install`
- To deploy contract, from the root directory, run `truffle migrate --reset --network YOUR_NETWORK_HERE`
- To run local server, from `/client`, run `npm run start`
- And we're live!
